# NY-Citibike-with-Tableau


[link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexander.litras)



Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this project we use Tableu to create a story to convince investors to invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines similar to the one in NY's Citi Bike. 
For this analysis we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, we added these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


Results:

Some of the results can be viewed below. 
2 Vizzes have been made from the module, and 5 from the challenge.

Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
We can observe that most subscribers are men and that the peak hours are in the afternoon. 
In the future it would be nice to vizualize the number of bikes that go missing or are damaged, and to vizualize how the types of customers heard about the program.
